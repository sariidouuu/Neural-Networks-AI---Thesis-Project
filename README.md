# Neural Networks AI — Thesis Project

A comprehensive Full-Stack Web Application featuring a custom Neural Network trained to provide intelligent responses regarding "Machine Learning" and "Neural Networks" course theory.

## 🚀 Overview
This project is my undergraduate thesis (2026). Unlike applications that rely on external APIs (like OpenAI), this chatbot is built from scratch. It features a custom-trained model based on a specialized JSON dataset using the PyTorch framework.

The application allows users to query Machine Learning and Neural Networks concepts through a modern web interface and receive real-time, accurate explanations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
* **HTML5 / CSS3**: Responsive UI structure and styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles asynchronous communication (Fetch API) with the backend.

### Backend (AI Engine)
* **Python**: Core programming language.
* **Flask**: REST API development to bridge the Frontend and the AI model.
* **PyTorch**: Design and training of the Deep Learning Neural Network.
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Natural Language Processing (Tokenization, Stemming).

## 📁 Project Structure
